# MC6805P2_clone
Dumping MC6805P2 and programming MC68705P3 to simulate it

We created this project in order to fix an HP powersupply which has a failed MC6805P2. 
MC68705P3 is reprogrammable and can be used to emulate MC6805P2.

Thanks to Sean Riddle and his brilliant work on dumping and reprogramming this
Microprocessor, we were able to reproduce the dumping and reprogramming procedure
with an Arduino and a few extra components. We decided to build a dedicated board 
for those who may have similar need.
